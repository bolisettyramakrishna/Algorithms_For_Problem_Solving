### Count the Islands<a name="CountTheIslands"></a>
#### Challenge : 
  Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a   group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.
  For example, this matrix has 4 islands.
  1 0 0 0 0  
  0 0 1 1 0  
  0 1 1 0 0  
  0 0 0 0 0  
  1 1 0 0 1  
  1 1 0 0 1

### String of Parentheses<a name="StringofParentheses"></a>
#### Challenge : 
  Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).

### Minimum Coins 
#### Challenge : 
Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.

You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 25¢.
#### Solutions :
  * [MinCoins.java](https://github.com/vikumsw/Algorithms_For_Problem_Solving/blob/master/src/main/java/MinCoins.java)

### FindSquare 
#### Challenge : 
Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
#### Solutions :
  * [FindSquare.java](https://github.com/vikumsw/Algorithms_For_Problem_Solving/blob/master/src/main/java/FindSquare.java)
---
### Stack Using Heap
#### Challenge :
Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

push(item), which adds an element to the stack
pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
Recall that a heap has the following operations:

push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap
#### Solutions :
  * [StackFromHeap.java](https://github.com/vikumsw/Algorithms_For_Problem_Solving/blob/master/src/main/java/StackFromHeap.java)

### Can you make a palindrome from a given string
#### Challenge :
Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.
For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.
#### Solutions :
  * [CanMakePalindrome.py](https://github.com/vikumsw/Algorithms_For_Problem_Solving/blob/master/src/main/python/CanMakePalindrome.py)

### Intersect Area of two Rectangles
#### Challenge :
Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.
For example, given the following rectangles:  
```
{  
    "top_left": (1, 4),  
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height  
}  
and  
{  
    "top_left": (0, 5),  
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height  
}  
return 6. 
``` 
#### Solutions :
  * [RectangleIntersection.java](https://github.com/vikumsw/Algorithms_For_Problem_Solving/blob/master/src/main/java/RectangleIntersection.java)
