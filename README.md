### Count the Islands
#### Challenge : 
  Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a   group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.
  For example, this matrix has 4 islands.
  1 0 0 0 0  
  0 0 1 1 0  
  0 1 1 0 0  
  0 0 0 0 0  
  1 1 0 0 1  
  1 1 0 0 1
